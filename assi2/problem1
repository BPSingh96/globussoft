[Problem 1] In this problem we are asking for implementation of a function, f, that encodes a String.
The function f shall accept a String as an input and return the encoded String as a return value.
The encoding algorithm replaces every character in the string with the letter that has exactly the
same position when counting backwards from letter "z" (with alphabet sort order in mind.)
Non-alphabet characters are ignored.
Here are three examples:
[a] Letter "a" is replaced by letter "z" (because "a" is the first letter of alphabet and "z" is the first
letter when counted from the end of the alphabet list.)
[b] Letter "c" is replaced by letter "x" (because "c" is the third letter of alphabet and "x" is the third
letter of alphabet when counted backwards from letter "z".
